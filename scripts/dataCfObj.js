    methodology: '<p><b>a) Methodology of calculating sale price:&nbsp;</b>The price or NAV, an investor is charged while investing in an open-ended scheme is called sale or subscription price. Pursuant to SEBI Circular dated June 30, 2009, no entry load will be charged by the scheme to the investors. Therefore, sale or subscription price = Applicable NAV (for respective plan and option of the scheme)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Example: </b>An investor invests Rs. 10,000/- and the current NAV is Rs. 10/- then the purchase price will be Rs. 10/-&nbsp;and the investor receives 10,000/10 = 1000 units</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>b) Methodology of calculating repurchase price of units:&nbsp;</b>Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an open-ended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the &quot;Applicable NAV&quot; to calculate the repurchase price. Therefore, repurchase or redemption price = Applicable NAV * (1- Exit Load, if any)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> If the applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% exit load is charged, the redemption price per unit will be calculated as follows: = Rs. 10 * (1-0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80</p>\n',

    methodology: '<p><b>a) Methodology of calculating sale price&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p>The price or NAV, an investor is charged while investing in an open-ended scheme is called sale or subscription price. Pursuant to SEBI Circular dated June 30, 2009, no entry load will be charged by the scheme to the investors. Therefore, Sale or Subscription price = Applicable NAV (for respective plan and<br>\noption of the scheme)</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> An investor invests Rs.10,000/- and the current NAV is Rs. 10/- then the purchase price will be Rs.10/- and the investor receives 10,000/10 = 1000 units.</p>\n<p><b>b) Methodology of calculating repurchase price of Units</b></p>\n<p>Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an open-ended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the “Applicable NAV” to calculate the repurchase price. Therefore, Repurchase or Redemption Price = Applicable NAV *(1- Exit Load,if any)</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> If the Applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 1% Exit Load is charged, the Redemption Price per Unit will be calculated as follows: = Rs. 10 * (1-0.01) = Rs. 10 * (0.99) = Rs. 9.90</p>\n',

Pursuant to SEBI Circular dated June 30, 2009, no entry load will be charged by the scheme to the investors. Therefore, Sale or Subscription price = Applicable NAV (for respective plan and option of the scheme)</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> An investor invests Rs.10,000/- and the current NAV is Rs. 10/- then the purchase price will be Rs.10/- and the investor receives 10,000/10 = 1000 units.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>b)</b>&nbsp;<b>Methodology of calculating repurchase price of Units:&nbsp;</b>Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an open-ended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors.It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the “Applicable NAV” to calculate the&nbsp;repurchase price. Therefore, Repurchase or Redemption Price = Applicable NAV*(1- Exit Load, if any)</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> If the Applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and &nbsp;2% Exit Load is charged, the Redemption Price per Unit will be calculated as follows: =Rs. 10 * (1-0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80.</p>\n',

    methodology: '<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Methodology of calculating sale price</b>:&nbsp;The price or NAV, an investor is charged while investing in an open-ended scheme is called sale or subscription price. Pursuant to SEBI Circular dated June 30, 2009, no entry load will be charged by the scheme to the investors. Therefore, sale or subscription price = Applicable NAV (for respective plan and option of the scheme)<br>\n<br>\n<b>Example: </b>An investor invests Rs. 10,000/- and the current NAV is Rs. 10/- then the purchase price will be Rs. 10/-&nbsp;and the investor receives 10,000/10 = 1000 units<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li><b>Methodology of calculating repurchase price of units</b>:&nbsp;Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an open-ended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the &quot;Applicable NAV&quot; to calculate the repurchase price. Therefore, repurchase or redemption price = Applicable NAV * (1- Exit Load, if any)<br>\n<br>\n<b>Example: </b>If the applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% exit load is charged, the redemption price per unit will be calculated as follows: = Rs. 10 * (1-0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80</li>\n</ol>\n',

Pursuant to SEBI Circular dated June 30, 2009, no entry load will be charged by the scheme to the investors. Therefore, Sale or Subscriptionprice = Applicable NAV (for respective plan and option of the scheme) Example: An investor invests Rs.10,000/- and the current NAV is Rs. 10/- then the purchase price will be Rs.10/- and the investorreceives 10,000/10 = 1000 units.</p>\n<p><b>b) Methodology of calculating repurchase price: </b>of Units Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an open-ended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the ÒApplicable NAVÓ to calculate the repurchase price. Therefore, Repurchase or Redemption Price = Applicable NAV*(1- Exit Load, if any) Example: If the Applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% Exit Load ischarged, the Redemption Price per Unit will be calculated as follows: = Rs. 10 * (1-0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80</p>\n',

    methodology: '<p><b>a) Methodology of calculating sale price:&nbsp;</b>The price or NAV, an investor is charged while investing in an open-ended scheme is called sale or subscription price. Pursuant to SEBI Circular dated June 30, 2009, no entry load will be charged by the scheme to the investors. Therefore, sale or subscription price = Applicable NAV (for respective plan and option of the scheme).<br>\n<br>\nExample: An investor invests Rs. 10,000/- and the current NAV is Rs. 10/- then the purchase price will be Rs. 10/-&nbsp;and the investor receives 10,000/10 = 1000 units<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><b>b) Methodology of calculating repurchase price of units:</b>&nbsp;Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an open-ended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the &quot;Applicable NAV&quot; to calculate the repurchase price. Therefore, repurchase or redemption price = Applicable NAV * (1- Exit Load, if any)<br>\n<br>\nExample: If the applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% exit load is charged, the redemption price per unit will be calculated as follows: = Rs. 10 * (1-0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80</p>\n',

    methodology: '<p><b>a) The price or NAV, an investor is charged while investing in anopen-ended scheme is called sale or subscription price.</b> Pursuant toSEBI Circular dated June 30, 2009, no entry load will be chargedby the scheme to the investors. Therefore, Sale or Subscriptionprice = Applicable NAV (for respective plan and option of thescheme).<br>\n<br>\n<b>Example:&nbsp;</b>An investor invests Rs.10,000/- and the current NAV isRs. 10/- then the purchase price will be Rs.10/- and the investorreceives 10,000/10 = 1000 units.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><b>b) Methodology of calculating repurchase price of units:</b>&nbsp;Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which anopen-ended scheme purchases or redeems its units from theinvestors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, ifany, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV)i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted fromthe “Applicable NAV” to calculate the repurchase price.Therefore, Repurchase or Redemption Price = Applicable NAV*(1- Exit Load, if any).<br>\n<br>\n<b>Example:&nbsp;</b>If the Applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% Exit Load ischarged, the Redemption Price per Unit will be calculated asfollows: = Rs. 10 * (1-0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80&nbsp;</p>\n',

Pursuantto SEBI Circular dated June 30, 2009, no entry load will becharged by the scheme to the investors. Therefore, Sale orSubscription price = Applicable NAV (for respective plan andoption of the scheme)Pursuant to SEBI Circular No.SEBI/IMD/DF2/OW/P/2020/11099/1 dated June 29, 2020,Gazette notification dated March 30, 2020 for extending theeffective date for applicability of new stamp duty rules and as perNotification No. S.O. 4419(E) dated December 10, 2019 issuedby Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, Government ofIndia, read with Part I of Chapter IV of Notification datedFebruary 21, 2019 issued by Legislative Department, Ministry ofLaw and Justice, Government of India on the Finance Act, 2019,a stamp duty @ 0.005% of the transaction value would be leviedon all mutual fund inflow transactions i.e. purchases (includingSwitch-ins), SIP / STP installments (including dividendreinvestment) with effect from July 01, 2020. Accordingly,pursuant to levy of stamp duty, the number of units allotted to theunit holders would be lower to that extent. Kindly refer theexample below for better understanding.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> An investor invests Rs.10,000/- and the current NAV isRs. 10/- then the purchase price will be Rs.10/-. After deductionof stamp duty investor will receive 999.95 unitsInvestment amount Rs.10,000/- ALess: Transactioncharges (deducted andpaid to distributor, ifapplicable)NIL BStamp duty applicable(@0.005%)0.50 C = (AB)*0.005/100.005Net Investment amount 9,999.50/- D = (A - B - C)NAV Rs.10/- EUnits allotted 999.95 F = D / E</p>\n<p><b>b) Methodology of calculating repurchase price of Units:</b> Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which anopen-ended scheme purchases or redeems its units from theinvestors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, ifany, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV)i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deductedfrom the ÒApplicable NAVÓ to calculate the repurchase price.Therefore, Repurchase or Redemption Price = Applicable NAV*(1- Exit Load, if any)</p>\n<p><b>Example: </b>If the Applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% Exit Load is charged, the Redemption Price per Unit will be calculated asfollows: = Rs. 10 * (1-0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80</p>\n',

    methodology: '<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>a) Methodology of calculating sale price:</b>&nbsp;The price or NAV, an investor is charged while investing in an open-ended scheme is called sale or subscription price. Pursuant to SEBI Circular dated June 30, 2009, no entry load will be charged by the scheme to the investors. Therefore, sale or subscription price = Applicable NAV (for respective plan and option of the scheme)<br>\n<br>\nExample: An investor invests Rs. 10,000/- and the current NAV is Rs. 10/- then the purchase price will be Rs. 10/-&nbsp;and the investor receives 10,000/10 = 1000 units<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><b>b) Methodology of calculating repurchase price of units:&nbsp;</b>Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an open-ended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the &quot;Applicable NAV&quot; to calculate the repurchase price. Therefore, repurchase or redemption price = Applicable NAV * (1- Exit Load, if any)<br>\n<br>\nExample: If the applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% exit load is charged, the redemption price per unit will be calculated as follows: = Rs. 10 * (1-0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80</p>\n',

    methodology: '<p><b>Methodology and illustration of sale and repurchase price of units</b></p>\n<p>1. <b>Methodology of calculating sale price:</b>&nbsp;The price or NAV, an investor is charged while investing in an open-ended scheme is called sale or subscription price. Pursuant to SEBI Circular dated June 30, 2009, no entry load will be charged by the scheme to the investors. Therefore, Sale or Subscription price = Applicable NAV (for respective plan and option of the scheme)</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> An investor invests Rs.10,000/- and the current NAV is Rs. 10/- then the purchase price will be Rs.10/- and the investor receives 10,000/10 = 1000 units.</p>\n<p><br>\n2. <b>Methodology of calculating repurchase price of units:</b>&nbsp;Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an open-ended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the “Applicable NAV” to calculate the repurchase price. Therefore, Repurchase or Redemption Price = Applicable NAV *(1- Exit Load, if any)</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b>&nbsp;If the Applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% Exit Load is charged, the Redemption Price per Unit will be calculated as follows: = Rs. 10 * (1-0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80</p>\n',

Methodology of calculating repurchase price of units:&nbsp;Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an open-ended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the “Applicable NAV” to calculate the repurchase price. Therefore, Repurchase or Redemption Price = Applicable NAV *(1- Exit Load, if any)</p>\n<p>Example:&nbsp;If the Applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% Exit Load is charged, the Redemption Price per Unit will be calculated as follows: = Rs. 10 * (1-0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80</p>\n',

    methodology: '<p><b>Methodology and illustration of sale and repurchase price of units</b></p>\n<p><b>a)&nbsp;Methodology of calculating sale price:</b>&nbsp;The price or NAV, an investor is charged while investing in an open-ended scheme is called sale or subscription price. Pursuant to SEBI Circular dated June 30, 2009, no entry load will be charged by the scheme to the investors. Therefore, Sale or Subscription price = Applicable NAV (for respective plan and option of the scheme)</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> An investor invests Rs.10,000/- and the current NAV is Rs. 10/- then the purchase price will be Rs.10/- and the investor receives 10,000/10 = 1000 units.</p>\n<p><br>\n<b>b)&nbsp;Methodology of calculating repurchase price of units:</b>&nbsp;Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an open-ended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the “Applicable NAV” to calculate the repurchase price. Therefore, Repurchase or Redemption Price = Applicable NAV *(1- Exit Load, if any)</p>\n<p><b>Example:&nbsp;</b>If the Applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% Exit Load is charged, the Redemption Price per Unit will be calculated as follows: = Rs. 10 * (1-0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80</p>\n',

Kindly refer the example below for better understanding.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> An investor invests Rs. 10,000/- and the current NAV is Rs. 10/- then the purchase price will be Rs.10/-. After deduction of stamp duty investor will receive 999.95 units</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>b) Methodology of calculating repurchase price of Units:&nbsp;</b>Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an openended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the “Applicable NAV” to calculate the repurchase price. Therefore, Repurchase or Redemption Price = Applicable NAV *(1- Exit Load, if any)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> If the Applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% Exit Load is charged, the Redemption Price per Unit will be calculated as follows: = Rs. 10 * (1- 0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80</p>\n',

    methodology: '<p>Methodology and illustration of sale and repurchase price of units</p>\n<p><b>a) Methodology of calculating sale price:&nbsp;</b>The price or NAV, an investor is charged while investing in an open-ended scheme is called sale or subscription price. Pursuant to SEBI Circular dated June 30, 2009, no entry load will be charged by the scheme to the investors. Therefore, Sale or Subscription price = Applicable NAV (for respective plan and option of the scheme)</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> An investor invests Rs.10,000/- and the current NAV is Rs. 10/- then the purchase price will be Rs.10/- and the investor receives 10,000/10 = 1000 units.</p>\n<p><br>\n<b>b) Methodology of calculating repurchase price of units:</b>&nbsp;Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an open-ended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the “Applicable NAV” to calculate the repurchase price. Therefore, Repurchase or Redemption Price = Applicable NAV *(1- Exit Load, if any)</p>\n<p><b>Example:&nbsp;</b>If the Applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% Exit Load is charged, the Redemption Price per Unit will be calculated as follows: = Rs. 10 * (1-0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80</p>\n',

It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the “Applicable NAV” to calculate the repurchase price. Therefore, Repurchase or Redemption Price = Applicable NAV *(1- Exit Load, if any)</p>\n<p><b>Example:&nbsp;</b>If the Applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% Exit Load is charged, the Redemption Price per Unit will be calculated as follows: = Rs. 10 * (1-0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80</p>\n',

It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load,if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value(NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will bededucted from the ÒApplicable NAVÓ to calculate therepurchase price.

Therefore, Sale or Subscription price = Applicable NAV (for respective plan and option of the scheme)</p>\n<p><b>b) Methodology of calculating repurchase price of Units</b></p>\n<p>Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an openended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the “Applicable NAV” to calculate the repurchase price. Therefore, Repurchase or Redemption Price = Applicable NAV *(1- Exit Load, if any)</p>\n<p>Example: If the Applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% Exit Load is charged, the Redemption Price per Unit will be calculated as follows: = Rs. 10 * (1-&nbsp;0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80&nbsp;</p>\n',

    methodology: '<ol>\n<li><b>Methodology of calculating sale price:&nbsp;</b>The price or NAV, an investor is charged while investing in an open-ended scheme is called sale or subscription price. Pursuant to SEBI Circular dated June 30, 2009, no entry load will be charged by the scheme to the investors. Therefore, sale or subscription price = Applicable NAV (for respective plan and option of the scheme)<br>\n<br>\n<b>Example: </b>An investor invests Rs. 10,000/- and the current NAV is Rs. 10/- then the purchase price will be Rs. 10/-&nbsp;and the investor receives 10,000/10 = 1000 unit<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li><b>Methodology of calculating repurchase price of units:</b>&nbsp;Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an open-ended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the &quot;Applicable NAV&quot; to calculate the repurchase price. Therefore, repurchase or redemption price = Applicable NAV * (1- Exit Load, if any)<br>\n<br>\n<b>Example:</b> If the applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% exit load is charged, the redemption price per unit will be calculated as follows: = Rs. 10 * (1-0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80</li>\n</ol>\n',

Pursuant to clause 10.4 of SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI /HO/IMD/ IMDPoD-1 / P/ CIR / 2023/74 dated May 19, 2023., no entry load will be charged by the scheme to the investors. Therefore, Sale or Subscription price = Applicable NAV (for respective plan and option of the scheme)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>b) Methodology of calculating repurchase price of Units</b></p>\n<p>Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an open-ended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the “Applicable NAV” to calculate the repurchase price. Therefore, Repurchase or Redemption Price = Applicable NAV *(1- Exit Load, if any) Example: If the Applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% Exit Load is charged, the Redemption Price per Unit will be calculated as follows: = Rs. 10 * (1-0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80</p>\n',

    methodology: '<p><b>Methodology and illustration of sale and repurchase price of units:</b></p>\n<p><b>a) Methodology of calculating sale price:&nbsp;</b>The price or NAV, an investor is charged while investing in an open-ended scheme is called sale or subscription price.Pursuant to SEBI Circular dated June 30, 2009, no entry load will be charged by the scheme to the investors. Therefore, sale or subscription price = Applicable NAV (for respective plan and option of the scheme)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Example:&nbsp;</b>An investor invests Rs. 10,000/- and the current NAV is Rs. 10/- then the purchase price will be Rs. 10/-&nbsp;and the investor receives 10,000/10 = 1000 units</p>\n<p><br>\n<b>b) Methodology of calculating repurchase price of units:&nbsp;</b>Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an open-ended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any,shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the &quot;Applicable NAV&quot; to calculate the repurchase price. Therefore, repurchase or redemption price =Applicable NAV * (1- Exit Load, if any)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b>&nbsp;If the applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a2% exit load is charged, the redemption price per unit will be calculated as follows: = Rs. 10 * (1-0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80</p>\n',

    methodology: '<ol>\n<li><b>Methodology of calculating sale price</b>:&nbsp;The price or NAV, an investor is charged while investing in an open-ended scheme is called sale or subscription price. Pursuant to SEBI Circular dated June 30, 2009, no entry load will be charged by the scheme to the investors. Therefore, sale or subscription price = Applicable NAV (for respective plan and option of the scheme)<br>\n<br>\nExample: An investor invests Rs. 10,000/- and the current NAV is Rs. 10/- then the purchase price will be Rs. 10/-&nbsp;and the investor receives 10,000/10 = 1000 units<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li><b>Methodology of calculating repurchase price of units</b>:&nbsp;Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an open-ended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the &quot;Applicable NAV&quot; to calculate the repurchase price. Therefore, repurchase or redemption price = Applicable NAV * (1- Exit Load, if any)<br>\n<br>\nExample: If the applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% exit load is charged, the redemption price per unit will be calculated as follows: = Rs. 10 * (1-0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80</li>\n</ol>\n',

    methodology: '<p><b>a) Methodology of calculating sale price</b></p>\n<p>The price or NAV, an investor is charged while investing in an open-ended scheme is called sale or subscription price. Pursuant to clause 10.4 of SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI /HO/IMD/ IMDPoD-1 / P/ CIR / 2023/74 dated May 19, 2023., no entry load will be charged by the scheme to the investors. Therefore, Sale or Subscription price = Applicable NAV (for respective plan and option of the scheme)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>b) Methodology of calculating repurchase price of Units</b></p>\n<p>Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an open-ended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the “Applicable NAV” to calculate the repurchase price. Therefore, Repurchase or Redemption Price = Applicable NAV *(1- Exit Load, if any) Example: If the Applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% Exit Load is charged, the Redemption Price per Unit will be calculated as follows: = Rs. 10 * (1-0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80</p>\n',

    methodology: '<p><b>a) Methodology of calculating sale price:</b>&nbsp;The price or NAV, an investor is charged while investing in an open-ended scheme is called sale or subscription price. Pursuant to SEBI Circular dated June 30, 2009, no entry load will be charged by the scheme to the investors. Therefore, Sale or Subscription price = Applicable NAV (for respective plan and option of the scheme).<br>\n<br>\n<b>Example:</b> An investor invests Rs.10,000/- and the current NAV is Rs. 10/- then the purchase price will be Rs.10/- and the investor receives 10,000/10 = 1000 units.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><b>b) Methodology of calculating repurchase price of Units: </b>Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an open-ended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors.It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the “Applicable NAV” to calculate the&nbsp;repurchase price. Therefore, Repurchase or Redemption Price = Applicable NAV*(1- Exit Load, if any).<br>\n<br>\n<b>Example:</b> If the Applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% Exit Load is charged, the Redemption Price per Unit will be calculated as follows: =Rs. 10 * (1-0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80.</p>\n',

    methodology: '<p><b>a) Methodology of calculating sale price</b></p>\n<p>The price or NAV, an investor is charged while investing in an openended scheme is called sale or subscription price. Pursuant to clause 10.4 of SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI /HO/IMD/ IMD-PoD-1 / P/ CIR / 2023/74 dated May 19, 2023, no entry load will be charged by the scheme to the investors. Therefore, Sale or Subscription price = Applicable NAV (for respective plan and option of the scheme)</p>\n<p><b>b) Methodology of calculating repurchase price of Units</b></p>\n<p>Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an openended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the “Applicable NAV” to calculate the repurchase price. Therefore, Repurchase or Redemption Price = Applicable NAV *(1- Exit Load, if any)</p>\n<p>Example: If the Applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% Exit Load is charged, the Redemption Price per Unit will be calculated as follows: = Rs. 10 * (1-&nbsp;0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80&nbsp;</p>\n',

Therefore, Sale or Subscription price = Applicable NAV (for respective plan and option of the scheme)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>b) Methodology of calculating repurchase price of Units</b></p>\n<p>Repurchase or redemption price is the price or NAV at which an open-ended scheme purchases or redeems its units from the investors. It may include exit load, if applicable. The exit load, if any, shall be charged as a percentage of Net Assets Value (NAV) i.e. applicable load as a percentage of NAV will be deducted from the “Applicable NAV” to calculate the repurchase price. Therefore, Repurchase or Redemption Price = Applicable NAV *(1- Exit Load, if any) Example: If the Applicable NAV is Rs. 10 and a 2% Exit Load is charged, the Redemption Price per Unit will be calculated as follows: = Rs. 10 * (1-0.02) = Rs. 10 * (0.98) = Rs. 9.80</p>\n',
